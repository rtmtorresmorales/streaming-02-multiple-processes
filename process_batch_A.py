"""
Batch Process - first transformation

Reads from a file, transform, write to a new file.

In this case, covert degree F to degree C.

Note: 

This is a batch process, but the file objects we use are 
also called 'file-like objects' or 'streams'.

What makes streaming different is the input data is unbounded.

# Create a file object for input (r = read access)

# Then, for each data row in the reader
for row in reader:

    # set local variables for each column in the row
    # note: the order of the columns is important
    #       and must match the order in the input file
    # We really only care about the temperature column
    Year, Month, Day, Time, TempF = row

    # convert the temperature from F to C
    # use the built-in round() function to round to 2 decimal places
    # use the built-in float() function to 
    # convert the string (as read) 
    # to a float (a floating point number) or decimal

    # put the values in a list (see the square brackets)
    # and write the list of values to the output file
    writer.writerow([Year, Month, Day, Time, TempC])

# this is important
